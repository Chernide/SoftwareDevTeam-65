# SoftwareDevTeam-65
**Team Name:** Noise Cancelling Politics  
**Members:** Krishna Dholakiya, Eoin Doherty, Austin Argueso-Nott, Denver Chernin, Albert Huang, Tyler Bagala  

**Vision Statement:**

We strive to achieve political literacy and increase political engagement locally and at a larger scale. 

**Automated Tests:**

The automated test tool that we used to debug is called pyunit (from the [Python Wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyUnit)), which is tied in with Flask (i.e. the Python framework we are using for our API layout).

**User Acceptance Tests**

The three tests that were demonstrated through the pyunit testing were the sign-up/login for users, the displaying of federal level politicians when not logged in/signed up, and the ability to search for local politicians while logged in.

For the first test, we verified logging in by making dummy usernames and passwords to check if our sign-up system would verify the right format for email/username and password confirmation.
